</div>

    <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>11 c. flour</li>
    <li>2 T. yeast</li>  
    <li>6 T. sugar</li>
    <li>6 T. oil</li>
    <li>4T salt</li>
    <li>1 T. milk</li>
    <li>3 c. water</li>
    <li>Equipment: kettle, large mixing bowl, large mixing spoon (wooden), 4 cup glass measuring cup, plastic wrap, dish towel</li>
</ul>
      
    
    <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Put water in a kettle and turn on to heat up.</li>
    <li>Put 4 cups of flour and all other dry ingredients into a very large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour oil and milk into large glass measuring cup. If you don’t have a large measuring cup, combine ingredients in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Start adding the 3 cups of hot water. When you only have about a half a cup left, feel the water and keep stirring with the spoon.</li>
    <li>Mix the liquids into the flour with a large spoon. I use a wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining flour into the bowl, stirring as you go along. When it’s too hard to stir, add flour onto your hands and mix with your hands.</li>
    <li>Stop adding flour or add more flour to get a consistency where it’s no longer sticking to your fingers.</li>
    <li>Knead about ten minutes. You can’t overknead when you are doing it by hand. You lift the bread onto its end, push it down and forward, and then turn it.</li>
    <li>Stop when it’s satiny and it springs back right away when you press on it.</li>
    <li>Pour oil around the edge of the bowl. Spin the dough around in the oil to cover the dough and the bowl with oil.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a towel.</li>
    <li>If you are in a hurry, put it in a warm place.</li>
    <li>After it has doubled in size, punch it down and form it how you’d like to cook it: loaf, bread sticks, rolls, etc.</li>
    <li>Let it rise another 40 minutes before baking at 400 degree in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>

    <img src="Recources/Images/soup-2538888_640.jpg" alt="">

    <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 carrots</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>1 1/2 c. red lentils</li>
    <li>1 T. Vegeta</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper as desired</li>
</ul>

    <p>Equipment: soup pot, stirring spoon, sharp knife, grater</p>

    <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Grate two carrots.</li>
    <li>Finely dice a medium onion.</li>
    <li>Saute the onion in a splotch of oil in the pot. Traditionally you'd add a tablespoon or two of tomato paste at this point.</li>
    <li>Add 7 cups of water, the carrots, and lentils.</li>
    <li>Season with Vegeta.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil and then turn to the lowest simmer.</li>
    <li>It will take about an hour for the lentils to cook.</li>
</ol>
    <p>Notes: You can let it cook for as long as you like, but keep it on very low heat and stir whenever you walk past.</p>
